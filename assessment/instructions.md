### INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Git clone this `practice_assessment` folder to your computer

2. Copy this `assessment` folder over to your personal repository within github.com/ACCComputerLiteracy, so you may edit the contents there and commit/push them for grading.

   And push your answers to

3. There's a folder for each question. You can create additional files within the folder if it helps you arrive at an answer and demonstrate your solution.

### INTEGRITY:

Some ground rules you are expected to follow:

1. No sharing of direct or indirect answers.
2. Absolutely no sharing of answer code.
3. No sharing of url references, your peers can web search too.
4. Any clarification from instructors should be posted on Slack under the channel **#\_exams** so that all students have access to the same clarification.
5. If you must copy code from the internet, alter it to your style. Also, you MUST provide comments to display your understanding of the concepts; else copied code from the internet would attract 100% penalty.

3. Evidence of understanding of the underlying concepts related to the question.
